# Burrito Bot

During the NBA Finals, Chipotle had a promotion in which the would tweet out a code for a free burrito every time a commentator said "free" during the broadcast. They would give out roughly 1000 burritos for each code, and the excited populace was very quick to claim those burritos very quickly after the code was tweeted. In order to ensure I would win a free burrito, I wrote this simple script to do the work for me. I just ran it at the beginning of the game and it would win the free burrito the first time they tweeted (as long as the tweet contained the word "text" followed by the code). I could only win the contest one time, so this was all for one free burrito (but it was an opportunity to learn new things nonetheless).
